    <h1>Goats</h1>
    <p>The domestic goat is a member of the animal family Bovidae and the subfamily Caprinae, meaning it is closely related to the sheep. There are over 300 distinct breeds of goat. It is one of the oldest domesticated species of animal, according to archaeological evidence that its earliest domestication occurred in Iran at 10,000 calibrated calendar years ago. Goats have been used for milk, meat, fur and skins across much of the world.</p>
    <p>These goats live in Geel. The pictures are subject to copyright.</p>
