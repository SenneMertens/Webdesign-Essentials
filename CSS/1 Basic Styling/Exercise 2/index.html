    <h1>The incorrect website</h1>
    <h2>Fonts</h2>
    <p><span class="accent">Flavors and colors</span> can't be disputed, one sometimes says, <span class="underline">although</span> there are some rules of thumb. If you want to be taken seriously as a web designer, you can use a sans-serif font for the screen with a custom fallback font. Only in the titles you may choose something more decorative. For printed matter, you may choose a sans serif font for the entire text, but don't exaggerate. Always check if the text is easy to read. If you don't want to be laughed at, don't choose the font 'Comic Sans MS' unless your client is an elementary school or nursery. There are always exceptions, but the use of that childish font is <span class="accent">rarely</span> justified.</p>

    <h2>Colors</h2>
    <p>Choosing colors isn't easy, but you can get help from the entire web design community that creates and distributes color schemes through dedicated websites. Make sure that your site doesn't get any discount shop-look (Aldi, Lidl, Zeeman, Wibra etc.), unless you consciously want to market a very cheap looking site, because <span class="underline">only then</span> a bright color is justified.</p>

    <p>If you want to design a site for a <span class="accent">general public</span>, it is best to choose a neutral shade of blue to finish the page. Leave extreme blue for what it is and continue with a less bright shade of blue. Choose a white background and combine with black letters. In all cultures this combination is appreciated.</p>
